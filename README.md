This project requires Unity3D to run. It was built on Unity build 2018.4.0f1.

To run the simulation in optimal conditions, it is recommended that two machines are on a wired network to ensure that injected latency values are consistent. Otherwise, if for example one machine or both are on WIFI, there will be additional latency on top of injected values. 

The simulation can either be run in the editor by loading the project and pressing the Play button, or a build can be made by going to File > Build and Run.

Once both machines are running the simulation, both must enter the same latency and packet loss values as well as specify whether to use rollback (if "use rollback" is unchecked, delay is used instead). 

One user must now enter the local IP address of the other machine and click connect. The game will then automatically start for both clients.

You can move your avatar with the arrow keys, and you can attack by using the z, x, and c keys for light, medium and heavy attacks respectively.

The game will end automatically once the timer runs out or one character has lost all their health. 

It is recommended that the simulation is restarted in between rounds.
